    "reviewText": "We ordered a Doppio Zero pizza. The toppings for this pizza are burrata, prosciutto, and arugula. It was my favorite. I enjoy it more than the comparable one from Terun. We also ordered a Mortadella pizza. Its toppings included both mortadella and crumbled pistachio. It was good but not as good as the equivalent we had in Italy. The pistachio was too crunchy."
